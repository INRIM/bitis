1. _xor_ uses comparison between times. If float, exact equality may be missed.
2. bin2pwm: to have int or float times set origin to int or float.

About stream
-new Stream class
-static vars: main stream list, triggered update,
  to_be_updated = {}, add here a stream when another stream on which it depends
  is changed, i.e. is called a write method on it.
  -each stream must have a list/dict of the depending streams
  -each stream must have a list/dict of the controlling streams
  -each stream must have an update method recomputing it from the
    controlling streams
  -present value
  -stream can have different depth (buffer size)
  -buffer size given as time elapse, alternative: number of signal changes
  -special streams: connector, connect a stream out (a tap 
    with a selectable delay) to the input of another stream.
  -main update method (clock), calls all stream update methods, first it
    sets the given end time of each controlling stream then it calls update
    methods of each depending stream.

  -each stream
    -has the end time = now_time when clocked
    -has min time = start time, the stream buffer threshold time
    -has buffer step, the buffer reduction step when min time is exceeded
    -can be clocked, different steam can have different clocks
    -has an in buffer, where changes are written before to be clocked
    -has an update method, recompute outputs from current inputs
  -first clock stream then update them
  -stream instances can be grouped
  -clock, update can applied on a group basis.
